It is hoped that the competition portion of this workshop will give you a chance to experience the process of solving real world machine learning problems and an opportunity to collaborate with other Danbury AI members and the Kaggle community at large.  We will be hosting the competition till our July meeting and will feature the winners solution in our [Danbury AI newsletter](http://eepurl.com/dxufLf). \n\n[You can access the slides for the workshop here. ](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Ut8dFGGvY-DjsnDuHOjrEo_uWXkyBtDDg_xO2aKgqGI/edit?usp=sharing)\n"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.5","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
